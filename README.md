This is a backend application built with **Express.js**, **Handelbars** and **Mongoose**. It a place where users can **browse** and **upload** photos of wildlife with information regarding the photo. It was made for educational purposes only. It has **user**s, who are able to **create** posts, **edit** and **delete** them. The users that are not authenticated are only allowed to browse and see the details for a post. Logged in users can **vote** (up or down) for a post.
